 in metastatic cancers
Research Question: How can structural bioinformatics assist in understanding the molecular mechanisms of ATP-binding cassette member B5 (ABCB5) in metastatic cancers, and leverage knowledge for potential therapeutic interventions through virtual screening and ligand interactions?
Case Study Description: Translocases, vital for molecules' transport across cell membranes, include ATP-binding cassette member B5 (ABCB5), found in metastatic melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. ABCB5 is linked to multidrug resistance (MDR), impacting cancer chemotherapy efficacy. This project centers on enzymes, such as " Translocases." The goal is to assess potential therapeutic interventions through virtual screening and ligand interactions.

The project involves:
Phase 1: Protein Selection
•	Obtain ABCB5 sequence from the Uniport database.
•	Retrieve their relevant functional annotations.
Phase 2: Structural Modeling and Validation
•	Predict the 3D structures using homology modeling to bridge the sequence-structure gap.
•	Rigorously validate the various models through structure-based validation techniques, focusing on structural accuracy.
Phase 3 : Mechanistic Insights and Drug Design
•	Go deeper into the structural details of enzyme-substrate interactions.
•	Perform molecular docking simulations to evaluate the binding of different ligands to the active site.
•	Infer the potential drug interactions with the highest 3 compounds of highest affinities
